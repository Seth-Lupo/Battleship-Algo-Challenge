# Battleship-Algo-Challenge
A competition to find who could write the best battleship strategy. :D

The goal of this project is to have YOU come up with a battleship strategy that wins the most when paired with every single other player. 
In each round, each bot will go head to head. They will be initialized and fight 10000 times. Whoever wins the most wins that round.

You can whatever library you please. Just make sure you install it on my venv so I can run it. 

Look at example.py for specifics on how to write it as well as tools for testing. You can copy template.py to get started.
If anything is unclear talk to me in person or email me at seth.lupo@innovationcharter.org
